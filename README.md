# CUDA-ML
This project is a small hands-on project to practice with CUDA accelerated GPU kernels. It consists of a number of different operations or complete AI layers to run directly on the GPU. Each implementation has both a GPU and a CPU version such that the difference in performance could be seen. 

 - Matrix Multiplication (Naive method)
 - Linear Regression
 - Dense Layer

In the future, I have the intention to add a convolutional 2D layer and a Transformer encoder block.
